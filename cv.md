## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer, SafeNow
*Dec 2024 – Present*

Working on the backend of SafeNow, scaled to over 1 million downloads across app stores:
- Built the data pipeline and reporting dashboards that gave sales and customer success real-time visibility into key metrics for the first time, eliminating manual reporting almost entirely
- Design and implementation of third-party integrations into the SafeNow ecosystem, prioritising high availability throughout - including connecting over 50,000 professional emergency responders via official emergency services (112). The platform has directly contributed to saving lives
- Implemented geospatial hotspot detection using ST-DBSCAN to cluster real-world app usage data into actionable leads, enabling sales to prioritise high-density areas and customer success to track regional engagement

### IT Consultant, Netlight
*Dec 2023 – Dec 2024*

Kickstarted a green field project for a leading automotive company with the following goals planned and achieved:
- Faster feedback loops by enabling test code execution in simulation - no cars required on the road
- Extraction, visualisation, and comparison of KPI trends across software variations of an Android infotainment platform
- Self-service data extraction tooling, allowing engineers to pull any data from virtual test runs on demand
- Improved resource utilisation by scheduling tests and analyses overnight on previously idle machines
- Repeatable replay scenarios and detailed performance graphs to improve defect detection
- Automated scheduling of background and parallel processes, including pre-configuring test machines before the workday begins

### Senior Software Developer, ProSiebenSat.1 Tech Solutions
*Oct 2022 – Dec 2023*

- Led the architecture and implementation of a mission-critical microservice that integrated a key third-party software, ensuring the delivery of live news broadcasts on German television
- Initiated and implemented a solution for end-to-end file tracking across different domains, significantly reducing user reliance on support by enabling them to locate files independently. This proactive approach resulted in a substantial decrease in support tickets received by the development team
- Revamped the Pull Request process with an emoji code system, clarifying reviewers' intentions, reducing misunderstandings, speeding up the process, and minimizing follow-up questions

### Software Developer, ProSiebenSat.1 Tech Solutions
*Nov 2020 – Oct 2022*

- Worked across acquisition, distribution, and content domains to build a unified platform for scheduling both linear television and on-demand streaming content
- Implemented a central video player, consolidating and replacing several fragmented solutions
- Refactored legacy code applying design patterns to improve maintainability and performance
- Mentored apprentices from onboarding through to permanent employment

### Software Engineer, ASAP Engineering GmbH
*Feb 2018 – Nov 2020*

- Managed a team of five, reporting to management on projects spanning Formula E and DTM racing
- Automated test simulation processes to fine-tune racing car performance, giving race engineers the data needed to optimise setups under real racing conditions
- Built a web application to automate a complex procurement process and streamline contract creation between suppliers and automotive OEMs

### Founding Engineer (Part-Time), Supplystudios GmbH
*Nov 2018 – Mar 2023*

- Designed and implemented a web application for parcel shipping and tracking, optimising costs per shipment
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline from scratch, maintaining high coding standards and ensuring reliable deployments
- Built a client application for invoice processing, saving accountants 4 hours per client per month

### Research Assistant, University of Tübingen
*June 2015 – May 2017*

- Developed static program analysis tooling within the LLVM environment, including visualisations for pointer analysis to improve code comprehension
